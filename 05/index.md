# HW5 - RESTful API Design - resources, URIs, operations

## Task

A company runs an application for a travel agency. Design a RESTful service where the resources have the base URI: http://t-a.org

The data model contains following entities: country (1) ← (0..N) location (1) ← (0..N) tour (0..N) → (0..N) customer.

Your solution should cover all CRUD operations for each entity/resource.

## Instructions

Design view on data model and design and describe the URIs of resources (At least one resource should provide filtering using query string parameter)
```
Example:
/customers - list of customers
/... - ...
```
Describe all available operations, associated method and possible status codes
```
/customers - get list of customers
HTTP method: GET
Status codes: 200 - ok, 400 - bad request
```
Do not forget to include HATEOAS principles

## Solution

### TODO - custom base uri 

The API is documented via Swagger UI
 
 * http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html (swagger)

 * http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs (api documentation)
 
In general, the status codes will be 200 if operation was successful and 404 if a requested entity was not found (eg GET /country/nonExistentId). 
The only exception are PUT mappings which will create the entity if it is not found.

>At least one resource should provide filtering using query string parameter

This is implemented for the Tour controller. Tours can be filtered by the country they take place in, such as

```GET /tour?country=de```

>country (1) ← (0..N) location (1) ← (0..N) tour (0..N) → (0..N) customer

I decided to implement following behaviour when deleting entities.

* When a **country** is deleted, all its **locations** are also deleted
* When a **location** is deleted, tours in that location will have their location set to null (ie a tour can exist without a location)
* When a **tour** is deleted, their **customers** will have that tour removed from them (ie customer can exist without a tour)
* When a **customer** is deleted, their **tours** will have that customer removed (ie tour can exist without customers)
