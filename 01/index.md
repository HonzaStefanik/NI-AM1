# HW1 - Integration Issues - Transformation of formats

## Task
Suppose that a customer of a travel agency submits his booking for a tour as a plain text (e.g. submissions via mail). In order to properly process such input in any system, a machine readable and standardized format is needed.

## Data

Implement a simple transformation in Java (simple microservice) that reads the first data format (“Data format 1”) and exports/prints the second format ("Data format 2).
 All inputs and outputs can be represented as String (or files).
 
### Data format 1:

```
Dear Sir or Madam,

please find the details about my booking below:

===
Tour id: "1"
Location: "Bohemian Switzerland"
Person: "Jan Novak"
===

Regards,
Jan Novak
```

### Data format 2

```
{
  "id": "1",
  "location": "Bohemian Switzerland",
  "person": {
    "name": "Jan",
    "surname": "Novak"
  }
}
```

# Solution

The application can be built by running `mvn clean package`, which also verifies tests passing.

It can be run with `java -jar *path_to_jar_file*` and it will start on `http://localhost:8080`

There is one endpoint - `POST /transform`. It will accept data format 1 and output data format 2 from the assignment. 
If any of the values is missing, HTTP 400 will be returned instead with an error message.

Example: 

```
$ curl -v -H "Content-type: text/plain" -X POST --data-binary @- http://localhost:8080/transform <<EOF
